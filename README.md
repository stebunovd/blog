# About

This is [my](https://github.com/stebunovd) personal blog. 

Why on GitHub? First, I like GitHub, and Markdown syntax is simple and good enough for my writing. Second, I don't want my posts to be immutable. As I grow older, I may have more thoughts on the topics that I wrote about, or my opinion may change. When it happens, I want to be able to modify my old article in-place instead of writing a new one. At the same time, I'd like to track change history and make it public for anyone who may be interested. Being able to link to a previous version of an article is also useful. Finally, I'm not a native English speaker, and I appreciate the ability to collaborate with my English teacher Matt on grammar and style.
