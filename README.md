# About

Hi, I'm Denis. For more than 20 years, I've worked in software development in
different roles - as a developer, engineering manager, product manager, and
CEO/CTO. I work at [ivelum](https://ivelum.com), and my current project is
[Teamplify](https://teamplify.com) - a productivity tool for software
development teams.

Here is my personal blog. Why on Github? First, I like GitHub, and Markdown
syntax is simple and good enough for my writing. Second, I don't want my posts
to be immutable. As I grow older, I may have more thoughts on the topics that I
wrote about, or my opinions may change. In such a case, I'd like to modify an
old article instead of writing a new one. Change history is available on GitHub
for anyone who may be interested.
