Hi, I'm Denis. I got my first full-time job as a developer in 1999 and have been working in
software development ever since then. I wear different hats - a developer, an engineering manager,
and a product manager.

I'm CTO at [ivelum](https://ivelum.com), where we build custom software for startups and
enterprises, and I also work on [Teamplify](https://teamplify.com) â€“ a team management suite for
engineering teams.

I live in Vilnius, ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡¹Lithuania, and I also travel quite often. You can find me on 
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/dstebunov), [GitHub](https://github.com/stebunovd), 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/denis-stebunov/),
or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stebunovd/). If you'd like to discuss a potential project
or book a consultation â€“ feel free to drop me a line at
[denis@stebunov.com](mailto:denis@stebunov.com).
